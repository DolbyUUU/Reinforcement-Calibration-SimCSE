# Reinforcement-Calibration-SimCSE
Reinforcement Calibration SimCSE, combining contrastive learning, artificial potential fields, perceptual loss, and RLHF to achieve improved Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) embeddings. PyTorch-based implementations of PerceptualBERT and ForceBasedInfoNCE, along with fine-tuning capabilities via RLHF and evaluation using SentEval.
